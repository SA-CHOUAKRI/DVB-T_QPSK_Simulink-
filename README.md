# DVB-T_QPSK_Simulink-
Modified DVB T Simulink model (“commdvbt”) to support QPSK modulation instead of 64 QAM
The result is a Simulink file (“commdvbt_QPSK_FINAL.slx”) that implements a full DVB T (digital video broadcast – terrestrial) chain using QPSK. The MATLAB code for baseband processing is integrated into the model so no extra preprocessing is needed. The Simulink model solves the problem of simulating and analyzing QPSK modulated DVB T transmissions in MATLAB/Simulink.
